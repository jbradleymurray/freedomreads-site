Introduction: The 2025 Inside Literary Prize orientation sessions kicked off with an esteemed cohort of Inside Judges! Across 13 prisons in five states and Puerto Rico, over 300 incarcerated individuals stepped into the role of judges and are taking part in an initiative that elevates the voice and agency of those locked up. With these four books in hand, *Chain-Gang All-Stars*, *On a Woman's Madness*, *This Other Eden*, and *Blackouts*, these sessions, both virtual and in-person, were not just about preparing judges for the task ahead, selecting a book they felt the world needed to read, but about creating a space where their voices, perspectives, and experiences could be amplified and recognized. The men and women Inside are central to the conversation about literature in America.

Dwayne said in the video: “Your voice matters. And these writers are happy and excited to have you read their work and be talking about it. These writers are eager for you to read their work and engage with it, not because they need to be heard, but because they need to hear from you.”</p><p>Coordinating sessions at multiple facilities across the country meant balancing both in-person and virtual meetings, each with its own set of challenges, but highly rewarding for all. David Perez DeHoyos, Freedom Reads Library Coordinator, and I navigated this dynamic with one mission: to break down barriers, engage great books, bring necessary comedic relief, and ensure every judge felt valued. Whether through a screen or face-to-face, the excitement and depth of conversations were like none other. We met some of the most well read people in the country for sure.</p><p>Many of the judges were initially reserved, unsure of what to expect. Getting people to open up and communicate with two strangers, David and me, was a challenge at first. But, David and I are truly a two-man show of laughs. Also, the shared experience of incarceration bridged that gap as it always does. Both David and I have served time, collectively over 30 years. We understand the weight of prison walls, the power of books to transport, and the significance of having a voice in a world that too often silences those on the Inside. We gathered in solidarity,  folks with state numbers leading these conversations now, both Inside and out.</p><p>Heather Ann from California, incarcerated in the largest women’s facility in the country, spoke with admiration about Freedom Reads: \"Your organization is a game changer. I can still remember clearly the day the trucks pulled up with those beautiful bookshelves and so many books.<em>\" </em>Her words were a testament to the transformative power of literature, how access to books can change not just a moment, but an entire outlook on life.</p><p>Erica Dawn, also from California, shared her deeply personal connection to literature: \"Books have been a part of my life since I could read. I was 20 when I was arrested and have been incarcerated for 31 years. I can relate to the transformative power of books.\" Her testimony underscored why the Inside Literary Prize matters; it is not just about selecting a winner but about reinforcing the profound impact of literature behind prison walls.</p><p>For many Inside judges, reading is more than an escape, it is a mirror reflecting their own lives. Michael from Illinois, for instance, picked up <em>Chain-Gang All-Stars </em>and felt an immediate connection: \"Although it’s fictional, I feel like parts of my own story are being narrated.\" Fiction, in this sense, becomes an avenue for self recognition and validation.</p><p>From Illinois: “When folks leave they don’t reach back. They come back. You both reached back. That’s love, man. Thank you.”</p><p>Then there was Alan, also from Illinois, whose words lingered long after our conversation ended: \"I got 43 and still counting, and you know every day ain’t the same. Tomorrow could be that day.\" He wasn’t just talking about time, he was speaking to the resilience required to endure it. How does one get through decades on the Inside? His advice to David and me was profound, \"Stay strong and focus, my brothers. One day at a time, that’s how they made the rules, you dig?\"</p><p>This is the essence of the Inside Literary Prize, not just judging books but elevating voices that have long been ignored. As David and I emphasized throughout the sessions, our goal is to amplify these perspectives. Freedom is not just about physical release, it is about being heard, about having one’s opinions valued.</p><p>A prison fence, razor wire as a demarcation line, does not determine the worth of a person’s insights or experiences. The Inside Literary Prize is not just about recognizing great books, it is about recognizing the humanity of those who read and judge them from the Inside. Through the Center for Justice Innovation, the National Book Foundation, and Lori Feathers, our partners in the Inside Literary Prize, Freedom Reads is building bridges that connect those Inside to the broader world of readers and writers.</p><p>As we move forward in this year’s Inside Literary Prize, the voices of these incarcerated judges will ring out louder than ever. Their insights matter. Their stories matter. And through this journey as they cast their votes to declare a winner, their voices will not just be heard, they will be impossible to ignore.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"e664e735-b8e0-4f18-91bf-52967187e30c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
