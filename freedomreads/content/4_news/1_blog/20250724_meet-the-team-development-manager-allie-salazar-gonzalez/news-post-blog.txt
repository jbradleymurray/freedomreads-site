Introduction: At Freedom Reads, Allie serves as our Development Manager—but she’ll be the first to tell you that title only scratches the surface. Her work goes far beyond fundraising. From writing grant proposals to engaging with our Library Patrons, Allie is a key part of bringing our mission to life. She’s traveled to all 15 stops of the Inside Literary Prize tour this year, helping collect stories, discuss books, and take photos.

Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>As she puts it, “I kind of see myself as a little bit of a reporter, trying to elevate the voices from folks inside and get them outside.”</p><p>Allie travels extensively with our libraries team and was present at all 15 stops of the 2024 Inside Literary Prize tour. At each prison, she supports the team by documenting our work—capturing photos, recording audio, and, more importantly, listening to the people Inside. \"My greatest pleasure is bonding with our library patrons over books, exchanging stories, and sharing these moments of unfettered joy with the world.\"</p><p>When it comes to mental health and healing, Allie believes books are more than just resources—they are lifelines. “Books help people hold on to their humanity, especially in places that erode your sense of self,” she says. “They offer a space for self-reflection, for staying in touch with your emotions, and that is essential to mental wellbeing.”</p><p>She recalls a powerful moment from one of the Inside Literary Prize tour stops in New Jersey. A woman incarcerated at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility shared how reading On a Woman’s Madness by Astrid Roemer gave her language to articulate trauma she hadn’t yet been able to unpack—even in therapy. Seeing herself in the book’s main character allowed her to begin conversations about her past. “Even though it’s fiction,” Allie says, “that book gave her words she never had before.”</p><p>For Allie, the Freedom Library is not only a place for books—it’s a place for community and connection. “Sometimes it’s not even about the books themselves,” she says. “It’s the gathering space they create. People talk to each other around the Library, maybe about a book or maybe about something that’s been bothering them. That’s part of mental wellness—having a space to feel and to share.”</p><p>Working at Freedom Reads has also shaped Allie’s own understanding of mental health, particularly in marginalized communities. “I think mental wellness means having the space to slow down and feel your emotions,” she says. “That’s not something everyone gets to do—especially in prison, or when you’re navigating the world as a person of color, a woman, or someone queer like I am. But this work helps carve out that space.”</p><p>One book that deeply impacted Allie is This Other Eden by Paul Harding, which she discovered through the Inside Literary Prize. “It’s been a long time since I felt moved by writing in that way,” she says. “Every word felt like a delicious morsel. It reminded me of what books can do—how the words contained within can change you.”</p><p>For Allie and so many others, books are not just a tool for learning. They are a refuge, a mirror, a companion—and sometimes, the very beginning of healing.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"ee587af1-75ef-487f-897c-42bfcc212221","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
