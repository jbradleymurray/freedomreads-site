Introduction: To encapsulate their summer spent at Freedom Reads, our interns reflected on experiences that were both deeply personal and profoundly connected to the organization’s mission. A shared sentiment ran through each of their reflections: gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful work and admiration for the passion of the Freedom Reads team. At the same time, each intern brought a distinct perspective, shaped by the projects they took on and the memories they carried away.

She dove into landscape reports on prison policies in 4 different states, finding joy in the rigor of learning and the encouragement of mentors who reminded her that every contribution mattered. Even as a remote intern, she felt welcomed and valued, leaving with the conviction that her work would have a lasting impact.</p><p><strong>Maddie Westall</strong> found herself most moved by the voices of those inside. Supporting the weekly letter video series gave her a direct window into the gratitude and hope expressed by incarcerated readers. Reading their letters transformed the work from something abstract into something profoundly human, reinforcing the idea that Freedom Reads is not just about books, but about connection, recognition, and dignity.</p><p>For <strong>Kiran Yeh</strong>, their internship bridged the intellectual and the tangible. Contributing to the Inside Literary Prize allowed her to witness the exchange of respect between incarcerated readers and celebrated authors. Yet her most vivid memory came from building a bookshelf in the workshop, where she was welcomed warmly and taught each step of the craft. That moment underscored the organization’s unique blend of scholarship and physical labor—proof that Freedom Reads is present from beginning to end, from bookshelves to libraries.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Sasha Rotko</strong> carried the responsibility of shaping voices through audio. Producing the second season of <em>The Freedom Takes</em> podcast offered both technical learning and the humbling realization that the most important voices to foreground are not our own. Through this work, Sasha gained a new framework for listening, one that will continue to shape how she engages with the world beyond Freedom Reads.</p><p>This year’s interns experienced many facets of Freedom Reads’ work: research and storytelling, prisons and podcasts, bookshelves and letters. Each intern left with a deepened sense of purpose, a respect for the labor—both intellectual and physical—that drives the mission, and a lasting gratitude for being part of a team committed to amplifying voices that too often go unheard.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"b1f0f101-5bb4-44b7-ac9d-f4abd5931708","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
