Introduction: I stumbled upon Freedom Reads Founder Reginald Dwayne Betts’ book, *FELON*, in a random room at Cybulski Correctional Institution in Enfield, Connecticut. I talked about the book with my now colleague, Steven Parkhurst, while we were both on the inside. Steve talked about potentially speaking with Dwayne soon and I talked about what amazing work Freedom Reads was doing. We both talked about how thrilling it would be to work for an organization like that.

Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Last year on April 17th, I was released from prison. I woke up on that day still feeling all of the feelings in my chest as to how it would feel to walk out of prison and leave the men that I cemented relationships with on the inside.  </p><p>Coincidences are funny. I wrote to Freedom Reads during my incarceration, penning a letter to Dwayne and to Steven, who was released before me and had started working with Freedom Reads. The end of the letter went as follows: </p><p>“I included a letter for R.D. Betts too. I would love to introduce myself formally. Maybe there’s a spot for me when I’m released - God-willing, this February. I'd love to help out however I can. Take care of yourself. Many blessings.” </p><p>It’s been a little over a year since I was released. I became employed with Freedom Reads on October 3rd, 2023. I have had the immense pleasure of working with guys that I did time with and meeting new people that are passionate about bringing the power of literature into prisons across the country. </p><p>Reading was crucial to me on the inside. We were constantly on lockdown because of the pandemic, and the only way to properly escape was through books. After reading a book, I’d take everything that I learned about the book and share it with the guys who looked out for me on the inside. Now, it’s what I get to do as a career. To bring books to our library patrons on the inside. </p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"f8908f7b-a830-41aa-87a7-3adbc2e58674","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://AiMINA6aG5XVrpsp"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"b28f5b4a-040f-4738-b934-eaf2a991d5b5","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>On April 4th, I was able to attend my first library opening with the Freedom Reads team at Arkansas Valley Correctional Center in Ordway, Colorado. If you were to ask me a year ago whether I would ever be back in a prison doing the work that Freedom Reads does, I would have laughed. But, I wouldn’t change it for the world. Bringing joy and literature to the inside is necessary, and I am grateful and honored to be working to help make the lives of the men and women on the inside a little better.
