Title: Founder’s Take: Names Matter

----

Featureimg:

Introduction: Names matter. In prison, I found myself around a bunch of teenagers who, wanting to be more than whatever crime landed them there, gave themselves the names they hoped to grow into. I took on Shahid, meaning "witness," true to the way the things I'd see would shape me afterward. Then, I came home to reclaim my father's name and try again to make good on whatever his parents imagined it promised him, and what he and my moms had imagined it promised me.

The poet and YA phenom Erika Sánchez, a recent guest on <u><a href=\"https://the-freedom-takes.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">our podcast</a></u> whose book we’ve sent widely to juvenile detention centers, didn’t emphasize quantity when she told us, “<em>Reading allowed me to imagine a life different than the one that I was living.</em>” (Exactly.)
