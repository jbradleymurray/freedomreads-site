My name is Katriona Page and I’m a rising sophomore at Princeton University. Though I entered college as an English major, I’m now considering psychology, sociology, or anthropology. While researching summer internships, I was drawn to Freedom Reads first because of its intriguing name, then because of its mission. Reading has always been an integral part of my life, and I firmly believe in the power of books as a means of transformation, inspiration, and education; one of my favorites at the moment is <em>Our Missing Hearts</em> by Celeste Ng. This past year, I was also part of the Students for Prison Education, Abolition, and Reform club, where I learned more about issues plaguing the carceral system. Thus, Freedom Reads was the perfect intersection of old and new interests. </p><p>Over the summer, I’ve been working on an impact report, which will measure and demonstrate how Freedom Reads makes a difference. I’ve also been reading and responding to letters from Freedom Library patrons on the Inside and am continually moved by the depth of writers’ gratitude, generosity, passion, and fortitude. Working with Freedom Reads has reinforced my belief in the power of reading and the importance of acknowledging everyone’s dignity and humanity.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"false","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"574c9232-a3a1-419c-983d-f7387a7932d8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Twyla"},"id":"bdf547b4-3eff-46a1-a9ba-81a8677de7cd","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"image":["file://Jc8M27VamWVpG7fH"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"83a2f0f0-3401-4050-b05f-0e63789bac54","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I’m Twyla Colburn, a rising sophomore at Princeton studying psychology and computer science. My favorite book is Ishiguro’s <em>The Unconsoled</em>, and my favorite book I’ve read recently is H.G. Wells’ <em>The Time Machine</em>. </p><p>I was drawn to Freedom Reads because, being founded by a formerly incarcerated individual — Dwayne Betts — and with half of the team being formerly incarcerated, Freedom Reads has the all-important understanding of exactly what people on the Inside need and want and the expertise to execute it perfectly. When the product of an organization is the most beautiful, symbolic, and carefully-and-lovingly-curated libraries for the people who need and deserve them most, I could think of nowhere else I’d rather put my energy into. </p><p>This summer, I’ve been writing reports on the prison systems in states Freedom Reads hopes to visit over the next few years. I’ve learned a lot in my time here – ultimately, I started gaining the perspective needed to approach my future work informed by folks who understand the prison system better than anyone else. For that, I will forever owe a debt of gratitude to the wonderful people who welcomed me into their space for these few weeks that are flying by altogether too quickly.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"6de7607b-210a-4d81-a733-8aed73176935","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Melody"},"id":"b02d23ae-c75f-4012-be6a-9f07907054c2","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"image":["file://DhQSVuHiRkzT21sC"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"3df52ac9-97db-4f13-8952-e8e69ed574a4","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Hi, I’m Melody Cui. I’m a rising sophomore at Princeton University majoring in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a minor in History, and my favorite book that I’ve read recently is <em>Foster</em> by Claire Keegan. I was initially interested in working with Freedom Reads because of the emphasis this organization places on amplifying incarcerated voices; earlier this year, I didn’t have a very concrete idea of what I wanted to be doing during the summer, but I did know that I wanted to be surrounded by people with experiences vastly different from my own, whom I could listen to and learn from. </p><p>The last eight weeks as an intern on the Communications Team have been a crash course on what it means to go beyond listening and to move into finding new ways to reach audiences, particularly from the position of a nonprofit. From organizing audio recordings taken inside prisons to producing videos interviewing formerly incarcerated members of staff, I’m taking with me how important and powerful it is to hear directly from those impacted. Statistics and more situate us in necessary broader historical, cultural, and political context, but, ultimately, it is people and their lived experiences with incarceration that I keep returning to. I am eternally grateful to the Freedom Reads team and all who gave me the chance to listen in for a summer to people and stories I will keep with me forever.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"1444b229-323f-4b78-8e98-182b840c4c11","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Zoe"},"id":"5db50cdb-6a98-440f-b719-baf93e28a18c","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"image":["file://qnXY36AaHxGt1ptp"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"e62261ce-3f46-4967-9169-f7624d9bf81e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I'm Zoe Groh, and I am a rising senior attending Yale University majoring in Statistics &amp; Data Science and Sociology with a concentration in Economy &amp; Markets. My favorite book that I have read recently is <em>The Bell Jar</em> by Sylvia Plath.</p><p>What drew me to intern at Freedom Reads was the impressive growth of the nonprofit from a developmental aspect and the impact its presence has had on creating conversations about incarcerated communities aside from policy change. This summer, Katriona and I are assisting with writing Freedom Reads’ first impact report. By the end of this role, I hope to enhance my skills in utilizing academic literature reviews and primary qualitative resources – while relying less on quantitative statistics – to create an impactful report on the power of literature for incarcerated individuals. Through the work my team has done so far, it has become evident that not only has the literature provided by the Freedom Libraries had an immeasurable positive impact on the well-being of our Freedom Library patrons, but also the connections made by the staff of Freedom Reads.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"f9b17baa-2471-4778-9f0c-604ce9ede3b0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Felice"},"id":"8785a775-4958-4e39-ab5a-666abe9fa19e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"image":["file://bMZdfimOs1jW5unv"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"2a56e127-3876-46b4-9e59-27aff786dae4","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I’m Felice Dong, a rising senior at Yale University studying Statistics and Data Science. One of my favorite books that I’ve read recently is <em>Weyward</em> by Emilia Hart.</p><p>As a first-generation, low-income college student, I understand firsthand the rich, transformative potential of literature and storytelling. My grandmother learned to read through a single prayer book, opening new worlds of connection and understanding. Her experience instilled in me a great appreciation for the ability of books to build empathy and knowledge that transcends individual impact. Freedom Reads embodies this truth like no other organization, working to bring troves of books into prisons—spaces too often overlooked and neglected.</p><p>During my time at Freedom Reads, I’ve had the immense privilege of reading hundreds of letters from incarcerated individuals. I have automated part of the database housing these letters, and worked to perform qualitative data analysis to extract common themes, aiding in conveying the voices of people on the inside. Currently, I am conducting a landscape review of reentry employment models around the country.</p><p>In these few weeks, I have been deeply humbled by the kindness, courage, care, and talent I have witnessed in the Freedom Reads office and through the letters. This experience has not only affirmed the importance of books to me but also grown my perspective on people affected by mass incarceration—something I will carry with me as I continue my advocacy beyond my internship.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"c335680a-67c8-41e3-aea3-37649cd84130","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
