Introduction: In a recent trip Inside, there was a day that radiated with unexpected joy and connection. It was a special event organized by Freedom Reads. As you may know, our organization is dedicated to bringing the transformative power of literature to incarcerated individuals. The air was thick with anticipation as the day’s discussions unfolded. The inaugural Inside Literary Prize was at the forefront, with thoughtful conversations about why these titles mattered and how they could resonate with those behind bars and the world.

Despite being incarcerated in a men’s prison—a stark reality faced by many trans women—Bree's spirit remained undimmed. She was not just a participant but a symbol of resilience and the power of literature to bridge gaps and foster understanding, compassion, and empathy. </p><p>As the discussions ended, a cake was wheeled in, and the atmosphere shifted from scholarly to celebratory. Bree's birthday was coincidentally that day, and in a place where such moments are often overshadowed by the harsh realities of incarceration, this one was different. As the cake was placed on the table, a chorus of voices broke into song. \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Bree,\" they sang, with Tyler, Steve, and I joining in.</p><p>The sight was poignant—a woman surrounded by men who might have never crossed paths with her in the outside world, coming together to celebrate her life.</p><p>Watching this, I couldn’t help but reflect on my own experiences. Just a few weeks ago, I had celebrated my 28th birthday in the outside world, free from the confines of a prison or halfway house. I remembered my own birthday while incarcerated, surrounded by a dorm full of men, feeling a mix of shame and longing for the world beyond the prison walls. My virtual visit with family was a bittersweet reminder of what I was missing—tears flowing as I expressed my own deep yearning for freedom and connection.</p><p>Birthdays can be shitty while in prison, let’s be completely honest about that. Yet, upon returning to my dorm, I was met with a heartwarming surprise. My fellow brothers on the Inside had prepared a special birthday dinner which took hours to prepare. Candy bars, bags of Shabangs, and heartfelt shoutouts from my brothers on the Inside made the day special despite the circumstances. It was a reminder that even within the confines of incarceration, the human spirit could find moments of joy and celebration.</p><p>Bree's birthday celebration Inside highlighted the essence of why Freedom Reads’ work is so crucial. It’s not just about providing books; it’s about fostering connection. The impact of positive relationships and the transformative power of shared experiences are profound. In the world of incarceration, where isolation and hardship are often the norm, these moments of connection and celebration remind us that we are all part of a larger human story. Just as a good book can change a life, so too can a simple act of kindness and celebration bridge the gap between despair and hope.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"27f2a41d-6517-4625-ba6e-df9c99820cb2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
