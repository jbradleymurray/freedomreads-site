Introduction: I was so honored, grateful, and deeply moved to be invited to speak at the Inside Literary Prize event on July 10, 2025.   Not so long ago, within the walls of prison, loneliness was my constant companion. Isolation had become my reality, and hope felt like a distant memory. Each day felt heavier than the last.

I longed for connection but struggled to find it amidst the rigid routines and harsh surroundings. My world felt small and oppressive. I desperately sought something, anything, that could bring meaning and hope back into my life.</p><p>One day, amidst the routine, something unexpected caught my eye—a sign-up sheet sitting on a desk in the prison library. It was an invitation to become a judge for the Freedom Reads Inside Literary Prize. Intrigued, I signed up without hesitation, hoping it might offer some distraction or brief escape.</p><p>I could never have predicted how much that simple decision would change my life. Books began to arrive, and I eagerly devoured each one. With every page, I found myself transported far beyond my bleak surroundings. These books were not just distractions; they became lifelines, portals to freedom and imagination.</p><p>Reading reignited my passion for learning and opened my eyes to worlds, lives, and experiences vastly different from my own. I immersed myself deeply, finding solace and strength in the stories and characters. Soon, reading became a highlight of my days, something I genuinely looked forward to. It made me feel alive again.</p><p>Yet, perhaps the greatest gift was discovering I wasn’t alone in my passion. Other women in the prison had also signed up as judges. Initially strangers, we quickly bonded over our shared love of reading. We formed a community, coming together regularly to discuss the books, debate their meanings, and share insights. These meetings filled my days with purpose, warmth, and camaraderie—feelings I had almost forgotten existed.</p><p>Through our literary discussions, we began healing parts of ourselves we didn’t even realize were wounded. Literature allowed us to speak about things previously unspeakable, to see our circumstances in a new light, and to regain some measure of dignity and hope. Our conversations were more than just book discussions—they were lifelines, sustaining us emotionally and spiritually.</p><p>My experience as a judge for the very first Inside Literary Prize solidified my profound realization of literature's transformative power. Books had helped me reclaim my sense of self-worth and reminded me that I was part of something bigger.</p><p>The Freedom Reads Inside Literary Prize was more than a competition—it was my salvation. It gave me a community, a sense of belonging, and renewed hope for the future. It showed me the humanity within myself and others, something prison can so easily erase.</p><p>Now, being free, I carry the lessons, friendships, and strength I found through Freedom Reads. It forever changed the trajectory of my life, proving that even in the darkest of places, light can still break through.</p><p>To those who tirelessly support Freedom Reads—thank you. Your dedication and compassion changed my life and continue to change countless others. You have my eternal gratitude.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"558fbd82-f92f-4d21-8d8d-1bb042d57006","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
