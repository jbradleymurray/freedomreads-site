Intro: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Freedom Reads, founded in 2020, is a first-of-its-kind organization using literature to inspire and confront what prison does to the spirit. Freedom Reads shows up because the lives of people in prison matter. We bring beautifully handcrafted 500-book Freedom Libraries into prison cellblocks, and by doing so, bring hope and possibility to people there. Poet, lawyer, and founding CEO, Reginald Dwayne Betts, knows firsthand about the dispiriting forces of a cell. In 1996, at 16 years old, he pled guilty to carjacking and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Freedom Reads is his attempt to make sure others have access to the books that saved his life. Opening Freedom Libraries is the centerpiece of our work. <br></p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"dfb2a86d-6790-4e04-9509-aaad30f3c165","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

The Freedom Libraries are objects of beauty, handcrafted by teams that include people who have served time in prison. The curved shelves of the bookcases remind us that the universe bends toward justice — and through conversation and engagement, fellow readers share in the joy, belonging, and possibilities that such stories provide. As of September 2025, Freedom Reads has opened 520 libraries in 52 adult and youth prisons across 13 states (CA, CO, CT, IL, LA, MA, MD, ME, NJ, NY, OH, RI, and VA).</p>","sidebar":"true","pagefeature":"false","sbheading":"Vision","sbdescription":"A Freedom Library in every cellblock in every prison in America.

The Freedom Library is a physical intervention into the landscape of plastic and steel and loneliness that characterizes prison. In an environment where the freedom to think, to contribute to a community, and even to dream about what is possible is too often curtailed, Freedom Reads reminds those Inside that they have not been forgotten.","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"a3934290-7705-4c14-83ab-03b8745c44b2","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
