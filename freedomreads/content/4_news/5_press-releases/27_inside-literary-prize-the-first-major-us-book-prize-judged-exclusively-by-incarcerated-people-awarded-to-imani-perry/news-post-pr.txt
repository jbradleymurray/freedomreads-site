Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Last night, <em>South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation</em> by Imani Perry was awarded the inaugural Inside Literary Prize, the first US-based literary prize judged exclusively by incarcerated people. More than 200 people incarcerated in prisons across the country voted on the literary prize, a collaborative project of Freedom Reads, the National Book Foundation, Center for Justice Innovation and Dallas bookstore owner Lori Feathers.<br><br>At a ceremony in New York City emceed by Freedom Reads Founder &amp; CEO Reginald Dwayne Betts, authors, advocates, and the judges themselves (via video) spoke eloquently about the role that literature and reading plays in the lives of incarcerated people.<br><br>“Being a judge…just meant a lot for me,” said <strong>Chelsea</strong>, a judge at Minnesota Correctional Facility - Shakopee. “It meant that my voice mattered, because for the last four and a half years, my voice hasn’t mattered. I got to be Chelsea. I wasn’t just my number.”<br><br>“In this honor, I renew my sense of responsibility to the millions of people incarcerated and under state supervision,” said <strong>Imani Perry</strong>, winner of the inaugural Inside Literary Prize. “Not as a matter of charity, but rather out of the deepest respect for the insight that comes from seeing society from the corners that it keeps hidden. And for the wisdom of those whom it keeps out of view. But most of all out of care for those in the grasp of confinement. I think this prize is most of all a recognition of readers and may this recognition of the intellectual life that exists behind bars extend much further…God bless the organizers who believe in freedom. And, to the people inside, please know when I say ‘we’ and when I refer to ‘my people,’ I mean you too.”<br><br>Interviews with the judges from the Shakopee Correctional Facility can be seen in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrN-LEHyioVeDJfNITlsyz5Ac1kAh1X7/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"this video\">this video</a> and heard in a <a href=\"https://www.innovatingjustice.org/publications/inside-prize-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new episode of Center for Justice Innovation’s “New Thinking” podcast\">new episode of Center for Justice Innovation’s “New Thinking” podcast</a>.<br><br>The award’s shortlist included: <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/the-rabbit-hutch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Rabbit Hutch\"><em>The Rabbit Hutch</em></a> by Tess Gunty (Winner of the 2022 National Book Award for Fiction), <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/the-haunting-of-hajji-hotak-and-other-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Haunting of Hajji Hotak and Other Stories\"><em>The Haunting of Hajji Hotak and Other Stories</em></a> by Jamil Jan Kochai (Finalist for the 2022 National Book Award for Fiction), <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/south-to-america-a-journey-below-the-mason-dixon-to-understand-the-soul-of-a-nation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation\"><em>South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation</em> </a>by Imani Perry (Winner of the 2022 National Book Award for Nonfiction), and <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/best-barbarian/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Best Barbarian\"><em>Best Barbarian</em></a> by Roger Reeves (Finalist for the 2022 National Book Award for Poetry).

I believe no book is finished until it meets the imagination of another person. By imagining my novel, you brought it to life. I am honored to share this sacred collaboration with you.”<br><br>“I think this is such a beautiful and necessary initiative,” <strong>Jamil Jan Kochai</strong> said in recorded remarks. “And I hope that our literary institutions continue to support and advocate for the incarcerated writers and readers in our wider literary community.”<br><br>“This is absolutely necessary,” said <strong>Roger Reeves</strong>. “This is what literature produces, these are those intersections….Thank you, Dwayne, thank you National Book Foundation, and I thank all the partners for believing in a project like this, and for allowing us as Americans who are out here to see the absolute necessity of this thing.”<br><br>“This is their voice getting out. You get to see and hear what I get to see and hear,” <strong>Senior Librarian for the Minnesota Department of Corrections Andrea Smith</strong> said at the award ceremony. “I want to be clear, though. These reflections are hard-earned. These women showed up, did the work for themselves and for their peers. They didn't just read a set of four books and cast a ballot. They read and they discussed with specificity, and then they had more questions, so they re-read and came together again and debated.”<br><br>In December 2023, <a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Freedom Reads\">Freedom Reads</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"National Book Foundation\">National Book Foundation</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.innovatingjustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Center for Justice Innovation\">Center for Justice Innovation</a> announced the launch of the Inside Literary Prize (see coverage in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/books/inside-literary-prize.html?unlocked_article_code=1.500.XaXP.L-QKpngcdxwI&amp;smid=url-share\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The New York Times\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/dec/11/inside-literary-prize-prisons-book-award\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Guardian\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/newsbrief/index.html?record=4424\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Publishers Weekly\"><em>Publishers Weekly</em></a>).
