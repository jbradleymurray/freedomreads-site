We laughed, we wept, we imagined a possibility beyond prison walls, and we did it in collaboration with the leadership of the New Jersey Department of Corrections. And, most importantly, we tried to remind those Inside that their voices, their opinions, their lives matter.”<br> <br>\"We gratefully acknowledge Freedom Reads for their generous donation. The Freedom Library collections are more than books and resources,” said <strong>New Jersey Department of Corrections Commissioner Victoria L. Kuhn, Esq</strong>. “They are agents for transformation and possess the power to empower individuals, unlock opportunities, and build a culture of learning that directly supports rehabilitation, reintegration, and the creation of a more promising future.\"<br> <br>“Each book had so many layers of symbolism and messages,” <strong>Inside Literary Prize judge Tina at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility</strong> wrote to Freedom Reads. “I believe if I re-read these books again I would unravel more layers about each character. With each book I experienced many different feelings. These books were different genres that I normally don’t read but it was a good experience to venture out of my comfort zone.”<br> <br>Freedom Reads is a first-of-its-kind organization that empowers people in prison through literature to imagine new possibilities for their lives. The Freedom Libraries are the brainchild of 2021 MacArthur Fellow and Yale Law School graduate Reginald Dwayne Betts, who was sentenced in Virginia to nine years in prison at age 16. Freedom Libraries are spaces in prisons to encourage community and in which reaching for a book can be as spontaneous as human curiosity. Each bookcase is handcrafted out of maple, cherry, oak, or walnut and is curved to contrast the straight lines and bars of prisons as well as to evoke Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s observation about the “arc of the moral universe” bending “toward justice.”<br> <br>Books in the Freedom Library have been carefully curated through consultations with hundreds of poets, novelists, philosophers, teachers, friends, and voracious readers, resulting in a collection of books that are not only beloved, but indispensable. The libraries include contemporary poetry, novels, and essays alongside classic works such as Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em> and Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man</em> – titles that remind us that books have long been a freedom project.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"beb50ab6-c651-47cd-a443-f7e93af98134","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>About the Inside Literary Prize:</strong><br> <br>In 2023, <a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Freedom Reads\">Freedom Reads</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"National Book Foundation\">National Book Foundation</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.innovatingjustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Center for Justice Innovation\">Center for Justice Innovation</a>, with support from literary podcaster Lori Feathers, announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/showing-up/inside-literary-prize\" target=\"_blank\">Inside Literary Prize</a>, the first-ever US-based literary prize awarded exclusively by currently incarcerated people.
