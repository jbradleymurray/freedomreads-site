The Freedom Reads team will be visiting prisons across five more states and territories this spring to bring the Inside Literary Prize to all 300 incarcerated judges. </p><p>“Freedom Reads has always been about showing up for those Inside,” said <strong>Freedom Reads Founder &amp; CEO Reginald Dwayne Betts</strong>. “We are showing up this week in Illinois, bringing handcrafted Freedom Libraries full of great literature and the Inside Literary Prize to hundreds of folks inside prisons. The Freedom Library and Inside Literary Prize are about more than just access to books, they are about starting conversations and community around literature, and reminding those Inside that they have not been forgotten. We are grateful to the Illinois Department of Corrections for their partnership in both of these important endeavors.”</p><p>“Books are windows to worlds other than our own that allow us to dream beyond current circumstances, and access to them can be a lifeline for incarcerated individuals as an invitation to think, grow, and imagine new possibilities,” <strong>said Illinois Department of Corrections Director Latoya Hughes.</strong> “By bringing Freedom Libraries and the Inside Literary Prize into more facilities, we’re expanding opportunities for the individuals in our care to engage with the transformative power of language. We’re proud to partner with Freedom Reads to support programs that foster reflection, learning, and critical thinking skills.”</p><p>“It is with renewed vigor that I begin to read the four books which I have received,” <strong>Inside Literary Prize judge Sandra at Decatur Correctional Center </strong>wrote to Freedom Reads. “I am a 79-year-old retired Elementary teacher with a Masters in Reading and Writing Literacy. My mantra is: ‘If you can read, you can do ANYTHING!!!’ Looking forward to reading and enjoying the books!”</p><p>Freedom Reads is a first-of-its-kind organization that empowers people in prison through literature to imagine new possibilities for their lives. The Freedom Libraries are the brainchild of 2021 MacArthur Fellow and Yale Law School graduate Reginald Dwayne Betts, who was sentenced in Virginia to nine years in prison at age 16. Freedom Libraries are spaces in prisons to encourage community and in which reaching for a book can be as spontaneous as human curiosity. Each bookcase is handcrafted out of maple, cherry, oak, or walnut and is curved to contrast the straight lines and bars of prisons as well as to evoke Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s observation about the “arc of the moral universe” bending “toward justice.”</p><p>Books in the Freedom Library have been carefully curated through consultations with hundreds of poets, novelists, philosophers, teachers, friends, and voracious readers, resulting in a collection of books that are not only beloved, but indispensable. The libraries include contemporary poetry, novels, and essays alongside classic works such as Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em> and Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man</em> – titles that remind us that books have long been a freedom project.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"b3c1f2ca-550a-4174-b689-f556dd096a17","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>About the Inside Literary Prize</strong></p><p>In 2023, <u><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\">Freedom Reads</a></u>, the <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/\">National Book Foundation</a></u>, and the <u><a href=\"https://www.innovatingjustice.org/\">Center for Justice Innovation</a></u>, with support from literary podcaster Lori Feathers, announced the launch of the <u><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/showing-up/inside-literary-prize\">Inside Literary Prize</a></u>, the first-ever US-based literary prize awarded exclusively by currently incarcerated people.
