Freedom Reads is grateful to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for partnering with us to ensure these important conversations happen.\"</p><p>“Freedom Reads is transforming lives through the power of literature, proving that books can be a lifeline to hope, humanity, and personal growth – even behind prison walls,” said <strong>California Institution for Men’s Warden (A) Eric Mejia.</strong></p><p>“Books have been a part of my life since I could read,” <strong>Inside Literary Prize judge Erica at Central California Women’s Facility</strong> wrote to Freedom Reads. “I was 20 when I was arrested and have been incarcerated for 31 years and can relate to the transformative power. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this journey.”</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"17a7df57-b080-4f00-b812-271c0c5dc006","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>About the Inside Literary Prize</strong></p><p>In 2023, <u><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom Reads</a></u>, the <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Book Foundation</a></u>, and the <u><a href=\"https://www.innovatingjustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Justice Innovation</a></u>, with support from literary podcaster Lori Feathers, announced the launch of the Inside Literary Prize, the first-ever US-based literary prize awarded exclusively by currently incarcerated people.
