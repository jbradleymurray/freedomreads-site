Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom Reads</a> announced today the opening of its Freedom Library installation at the <a href=\"https://www.nbm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Building Museum</a>, an addition to the ongoing exhibit \"Justice is Beauty: The Work of MASS Design Group.\" This interactive installation is the first library of its kind shown to the public. Libraries like it are being built in prisons nationwide, the first of which opened at MCI-Norfolk prison outside of Boston in November. Freedom Reads aims to build 1,000 similar Freedom Libraries in prisons across the country. </p><p>The libraries, the brainchild of 2021 MacArthur Fellow Reginald Dwayne Betts who was sentenced to nine years in prison at age 16, seek to create a space in prisons to encourage the full realization of self and the exploration of new possibilities. Betts' own realization of his potential came through a fellow prisoner sliding a book under his door, which put him on a different path - one that included graduating from Yale Law School and becoming one of the most acclaimed poets of his generation. </p><p>Books in the Freedom Library have been carefully curated through consultations with thousands of poets, novelists, philosophers, teachers, friends, and voracious readers, resulting in a collection of books that are not only beloved, but indispensable. The emphasis is on contemporary poets, novelists, and essayists alongside classic works, from Homer's <em>The Odyssey</em> to the <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em>, that remind us the book has long been a freedom project.</p><p>\"The Freedom Library opened first in prisons in Massachusetts and Louisiana, and now the public outside of prison can see and touch it, too,\" said Reginald Dwayne Betts, Founder and Director of Freedom Reads. \"This exhibit at the National Building Museum lets visitors explore the collection and experience the same inspiration as the men and women in prison paging through these books. I know firsthand literature's power to remind people in prison what dignity looks like, and what freedom feels like. That's what our work to bring the Freedom Library to prisons nationwide is all about.\" </p><p>\"Freedom Reads libraries transform prison spaces, filling them with inspiration and hope. This landmark installation within MASS Design Group's Justice is Beauty exhibition at the National Building Museum adds a new layer of meaning and truly reflects MASS Design's belief that design can, and should, improve people's lives,\" said Aileen Fuchs, President and Executive Director of the National Building Museum. \"The Museum's mission is to educate and engage our audiences about the built environment and its impact on our lives and communities. We are proud hosts of this extraordinary collaboration and invite everyone to experience the Freedom Reads library first hand in its first public home.\"</p><p>This exhibit will be open to the public during regular visiting hours at the National Building Museum and be on display until September 2022. </p><p><strong>For more information about Freedom Reads and the Freedom Libraries project please visit </strong><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>https://freedomreads.org/</strong></a><strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>About Freedom Reads:</strong></p><p>Founded by Reginald Dwayne Betts, who knows firsthand the dispiriting forces of prison, Freedom Reads empowers people through literature to confront what prison does to the spirit.
