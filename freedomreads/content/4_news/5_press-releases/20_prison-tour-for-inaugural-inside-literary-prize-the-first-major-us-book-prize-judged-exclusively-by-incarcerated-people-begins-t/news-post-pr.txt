This shortlist was determined by a selection committee comprised of incarcerated readers, writers, and Departments of Corrections librarians, who selected the four books from the list of Finalists and Winners of the 2022 National Book Awards. </p><p>In January, team members at Freedom Reads packed and shipped out the four shortlisted books for the Inside Literary Prize to the hundreds of judges on the inside at both men’s and women’s facilities. Five additional sets of the shortlisted books were also sent to each of the prisons for those who are not participating as judges. In addition, copies of the books were provided to correctional staff at these facilities, to include them within the communities of readers. Orientation sessions were held remotely in March with judges across the 12 prisons to launch months-long conversations about books, the founding principle of the prize.</p><p>“I like the way I put it to the folks inside when I made the video orientation for our hundreds of Inside Literary Prize judges,” said Freedom Reads Founder &amp; CEO Reginald Dwayne Betts. “What you have to remember is that your voice matters, your opinion matters, and that all of these writers that wanted to win this prize and didn’t, and the ones that will ultimately win, are excited and encouraged and happy to have you reading their work and talking about it.”</p><p>\"We so look forward to hearing the judges’ thoughts, witnessing the powerful literary programming, and celebrating the shortlisted National Book Award–honored authors of the inaugural Inside Literary Prize,\" said Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation.</p><p>\"It’s very exciting to kick-off this inaugural tour for the Inside Literary Prize and to work with the incarcerated judges as they discuss the ideas and emotions that these great books inspire,\" said Lori Feathers, literary podcaster and co-owner, Interabang Books. </p><p>\"The Inside Literary Prize connects our shared humanity through the transformative power of literature,\" said Courtney Bryan, Executive Director of the Center for Justice Innovation. \"We are so proud to join with our partners to bring this tour to prisons across the country and share deep, meaningful conversations with hundreds of incarcerated book lovers.\"</p><p><strong>About Freedom Reads</strong>: <br><strong>Freedom Reads</strong>’ mission is to inspire and confront what prison does to the spirit. We bring beautiful, handcrafted bookcases into prisons, transforming cellblocks into Freedom Libraries. The Freedom Library is a physical intervention into the landscape of plastic and steel and loneliness that characterizes prison. In an environment where the freedom to think, to contribute to a community, and even to dream about what is possible is too often curtailed, Freedom Reads reminds those inside that they have not been forgotten.
