Special guest Lyndie Felsher, who was a 2024 Inside Literary Prize judge, also gave remarks reflecting on her experience as a judge last year.<br><br>“Reading brought me something invaluable—a community. For the first time in too long, I connected with women who shared my passion,” <strong>Lyndie</strong> said. “We laughed, debated, and bonded over stories that made our hearts beat with purpose again. Together, through literature, we found strength and unity in the most unlikely of places….Tonight, I stand here free, not just from physical confines, but from the isolation that once defined me. Literature gave me life again.”<br><br>The judges for the Inside Literary Prize are people currently incarcerated in prisons across the country. <strong>Rolando</strong>, a 2025 Inside Literary Prize judge at Western Illinois Correctional Center, shared: “I love it because it literally transports you into another world. And not only that, but you get to see the opinions and the ideas of other people, especially the author. And for me, it expands my mind. For me, not only does it transport me, but I get to learn more of the world. I get to learn of other cultures, of other people, and that, for me, is special, because it just opens up, just a new dimension.”<br><br>“There is no question that this is the highest possible honor a book like this could ever receive,” said <strong>Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah</strong>, winner of the 2025 Inside Literary Prize. “I take it to mean those who judged believed I was not careless or callous, that I use language in a way that felt like truth. This retroactive mandate is a gift I can never repay, but one I will forever be grateful for. I want to thank all those Inside, those who judged and those who did not. This award is dedicated to you all.”<br><br>The shortlist for the 2025 Inside Literary Prize included: <a href=\"https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/CTrYOzj7gXBOcdLfcDGVqBiNRHS67o6mfVThpCTPXOY=/kp5sdr8bQ0HikVuM9EUc0udj5MdKQGALVzl6F0SpTtw=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chain-Gang All-Stars\"><em>Chain-Gang All-Stars</em></a> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah; <a href=\"https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/CTrYOzj7gXBOcdLfcDGVqBiNRHS67o6mfVThpCTPXOY=/kp5sdr8bQ0HikVuM9EUc0oWK_e3BJBAj_J3-fChFh8o=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"This Other Eden\"><em>This Other Eden</em></a> by Paul Harding; <a href=\"https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/CTrYOzj7gXBOcdLfcDGVqBiNRHS67o6mfVThpCTPXOY=/kp5sdr8bQ0HikVuM9EUc0kYquDE-f2XKwq6g9CJsUy0=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" On a Woman’s Madness \"><em>On a Woman’s Madness </em></a>by Astrid Roemer, translated from the Dutch by Lucy Scott; and <a href=\"https://api.neonemails.com/emails/tracking/click-link/CTrYOzj7gXBOcdLfcDGVqBiNRHS67o6mfVThpCTPXOY=/kp5sdr8bQ0HikVuM9EUc0tNCco1tfJ1nNf7bUtloRZc=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Blackouts\"><em>Blackouts</em></a> by Justin Torres.
