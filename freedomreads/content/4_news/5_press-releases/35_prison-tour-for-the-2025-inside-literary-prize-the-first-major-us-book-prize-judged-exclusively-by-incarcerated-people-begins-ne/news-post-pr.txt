The inaugural Prize <u><a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/news/press-releases/inside-literary-prize-the-first-major-us-book-prize-judged-exclusively-by-incarcerated-people-awarded-to-imani-perry\">was awarded last August</a></u> by over 200 incarcerated judges to Imani Perry for <em>South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation</em>. This initiative, which is also supported by Lori Feathers, literary podcaster and co-owner of Dallas independent bookstore, Interabang Books, seeks to expand access to our country’s most thought-provoking literature for people who are incarcerated.</p><p>The Prize will be awarded in July 2025 by a jury of hundreds of incarcerated individuals from 15 prisons in six states and territories – California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, and Puerto Rico – to one of the <a href=\"https://freedomreads.org/news/press-releases/freedom-reads-national-book-foundation-center-for-justice-innovation-announce-shortlist-for-2025-inside-literary-prize\">four shortlisted books</a> under consideration: <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/chain-gang-all-stars/\"><em>Chain-Gang All-Stars</em></a></u> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/this-other-eden/\"><em>This Other Eden</em></a></u> by Paul Harding, <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/on-a-womans-madness/\"><em>On a Woman’s Madness</em></a></u> by Astrid Roemer, and <u><a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/blackouts/\"><em>Blackouts</em></a></u> by Justin Torres. This shortlist was determined by a selection committee of incarcerated readers, writers, and Departments of Corrections librarians, who selected the four books from the list of Finalists for the 2023 National Book Awards for Fiction and Translated Literature. </p><p>“The Inside Literary Prize is about many things – creating community and conversation around literature on the Inside, providing a platform for folks on the Inside to contribute to the national conversation around books, and most importantly, reminding those Inside that their voice, their thoughts, and their opinions matter,” said <strong>Freedom Reads Founder &amp; CEO Reginald Dwayne Betts</strong>.</p><p>\"The highlight of the Inside Literary Prize is getting to hear first-hand the brilliant and incisive deliberations of its judges,\" said <strong>Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation</strong>. \"We're so grateful to our partners at Freedom Reads for coordinating the many moving pieces of the Inside Literary Prize tour, and for the opportunity to introduce readers to National Book Award–honored titles and to center the connective power of exceptional books, writers, and conversation.\"</p><p>\"It's really exciting to kick-off the prisons tour for the second annual Inside Literary Prize,” said <strong>Lori Feathers, literary podcaster and co-owner, Interabang Books</strong>. “Sitting down face-to-face with the incarcerated judges and hearing their different perspectives on these extraordinary books is the beating heart of the Prize. Building community and understanding through books is of value everywhere, whether inside or out.\" </p><p>“When we helped launch the Inside Literary Prize last year, we were blown away by the enthusiastic participation of hundreds of judges in prisons across the country,” said <strong>Courtney Bryan, Chief Executive Officer of the Center for Justice Innovation</strong>. “The nominated books sparked vigorous debate and thoughtful choices, serving as inspiration, a lifeline, and a bridge between those on the inside and those on the outside. We’re thrilled that for the second annual Prize, we’re reaching judges in new locations, and look forward to gaining new insights into this year’s nominated books from our community members on the inside.”</p><p>This winter, Freedom Reads packed and shipped out the four shortlisted books for the Inside Literary Prize to the hundreds of judges on the Inside at both men’s and women’s facilities. Five additional sets of the shortlisted books were also sent to each of the prisons for those who are not participating as judges. In addition, copies of the books were provided to correctional staff at these facilities, to include them within the communities of readers. Orientation sessions were held throughout the spring with judges across the 15 prisons to launch months-long conversations about books, the founding principle of the Prize.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"2083d4ed-21c9-4d26-84c2-0f0f0737267d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>About Freedom Reads</strong></p><p>Founded by Reginald Dwayne Betts, who knows firsthand the dispiriting forces of prison, Freedom Reads works to empower people through literature to confront what prison does to the spirit.
