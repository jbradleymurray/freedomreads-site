Position: Library Production Associate

Bio: James Flynn works as a Library Production Assistant at Freedom Reads. James was incarcerated at 20 years old, and did 32 years from 1992-2024. James started reading books to escape his environment. Reading was what he referred to as a mental furlough. When he decided to turn his life around, he quit cursing (it's taking a shortcut in reasonable thinking and creates instant reactions) and attended countless self-help groups. He's volunteered/associated with local community service groups, including New Haven Rising, CCAR New Haven, and HangTime. One of James' great accomplishments is creating his own community volunteer group, THE FLYNN PROJECT - FAIR HAVEN MATTERS. The group goes around Fair Haven and cleans up areas (parks, walkways, overgrowth). James knew that he wanted to work in the non-profit world. How or where it would manifest, he wasn't sure. Landing at Freedom Reads humbles James. Its goal to help those incarcerated is worthwhile and James is proud to be a member of the Freedom Reads team.
