While serving 25 years in prison, James earned an Associate degree from Middlesex Community College and a BLS from Wesleyan University with a double major in Philosophy and English. He has published two papers in academic journals and published a book he co-wrote with three of his fellow mentors in the T.R.U.E. Program, a specialized unit in which older men mentor younger men.
