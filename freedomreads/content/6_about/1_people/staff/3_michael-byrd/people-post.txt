Bio: Michael Byrd works as a Library Production Assistant at Freedom Reads. As a proud electrical apprentice, Michael has always been fond of working with his hands, so it’s no surprise that he was inspired to join the team at Freedom Reads. This organization resonates deeply with Michael as he was once incarcerated, and understands the power of literature especially when a person is in despair. During his free time, Michael enjoys playing basketball, going for long hikes, playing chess, traveling, and reading, of course. One of Michael’s favorite books is *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* by Maya Angelou.
