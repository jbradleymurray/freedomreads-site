Bio: Kevin Baker manages the manufacturing and fabrication shop at Freedom Reads and oversees the building of our beautiful libraries. After a twenty year career in Financial Services, Kevin lost a long battle with addiction to opioid pain medications following several spinal reconstructive surgeries. Addiction led to financial crisis, and in 2016 Kevin robbed a bank, twice, and served six years in prison where he re-dedicated himself to a life yet to live. In prison, reading became a major part of his journey back. Kevin holds B.A. degrees from the University of Connecticut in Economics and English. Now reunited with his family, he lives in West Hartford, CT.
