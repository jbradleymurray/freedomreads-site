Bio: Anthony W. Marx is President of The New York Public Library, the nation’s largest library system with 92 locations in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island. Since joining NYPL in 2011, Marx has strengthened the Library’s role as an essential provider of educational resources and opportunities for all ages. Under his leadership, the Library has created new early literacy and after-school programs for children and teens, dramatically increased free English language classes and citizenship support for immigrants, added programs on Rikers Island and at the Manhattan Detention Center, and improved services for scholars and students who rely on the Library’s world-renowned research collections. Under Marx, the Library has also become a national leader on bridging the digital divide through its efforts to increase access to e-books, expand computer classes and coding training, and a groundbreaking program that provides home internet access to families of low-income students. Before joining the Library, Marx served as president of Amherst College from 2003 to 2011, during which time he tripled enrollment for low-income students. Before Amherst, Marx was a political science professor, focusing on South African politics, and director of undergraduate studies at Columbia University. Marx has a BA from Yale, and an MPA and a PhD from Princeton.
