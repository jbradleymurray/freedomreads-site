It was a lesson in critical thinking that helped me analyze each facet of the tale. I wasn't just reading about a foreign walk of life. I was living it.","citation":"Phillip Vance Smith II, 2024 Inside Literary Prize judge and 2025 Inside Literary Prize Selection Committee member, Neuse Correctional Institution, North Carolina","inline":"false","image":[],"sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"d76a54f3-d93d-4875-94dd-099ee09d5d4f","isHidden":false,"type":"quote-custom"}]
