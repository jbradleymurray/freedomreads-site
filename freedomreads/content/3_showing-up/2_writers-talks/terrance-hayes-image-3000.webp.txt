Alt: A black and white sketch of the audience members at Otisville Correctional Facility during a reading by poet Terrance Hayes. The figures are surrounded by notes and reflections from Hayes concerning their discussion, such as, “A brother said when he was in college he’d been persuaded somehow that he wasn’t a poet. I think he said the sonnet had something to do with it.”
