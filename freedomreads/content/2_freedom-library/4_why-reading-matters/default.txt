Maria lingered over the pile of Spanish books she had collected, deciding which to read first. “That’s me,” she joked when she pulled out Erika Sánchez's <em>I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</em>. Because she struggled to read in English, she told us that she would ask another woman in the cellblock to read it aloud to her. She craved the books in Spanish that she read easily and put a copy of <em>La Hija Unica</em> by Guadalupe Nettel in her cell. “All I want is to stay with the Library.”</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"e74a834a-4c92-4f67-8f8b-010c302ae2fa","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Reading is the last line of defense between the Wild West and you.
