Herotext: A public library<br>like no other.

Introduction: We place Freedom Libraries in the center of prison cellblocks where they become a locus of conversation and community. Freedom Libraries are objects of beauty, handcrafted by teams that include people who’ve served time in prison.

Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>19 months after being released from St. Brides Correctional Center, after being locked up for 24 years, Terrell “Star” Kelly drove Freedom Reads Founder and CEO Reginald Dwayne Betts back to that Chesapeake prison. This time, they were invited guests set to open 12 libraries at the prison and 12 libraries at the neighboring Indian Creek Correctional Center. Joining them was Dwayne’s co-defendant Marcus Bullock, who, with Dwayne, was convicted of carjacking when he was only 15 years old. Marcus drove down from Maryland, leaving his house at 4:00 a.m. to get to the prison where he too spent time. The last time any of them had woken that early to enter a prison they were in handcuffs.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"8a39f3e0-cf97-42ae-9400-f31af92accb9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://NsqMRVgP13wb8W6S"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"true","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"Read More","external":null,"link":"page://DCNPjG4J381fqATS"},"id":"23bff2c9-ee40-48cc-8daf-e4e07b170c37","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>On that spring day, these men and others who spent time Inside, carried hundreds of pounds of beautiful reclaimed wood, fabricated into bookcases, and the boxes of books that would be shelved on them, into the prison.

They not only lack community with the world of writers and poets outside prison walls, too often they lack community with one another. Freedom Reads works to change that culture by showing up, opening Freedom Libraries in cellblocks, providing natural beauty, new books, and a world of possibilities. Freedom Libraries not only provide opportunities for transforming communities, but act as a public acknowledgment that serving time should not demand you disappear.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"c7a965e8-bfb7-40d8-9b21-6636d8e8c207","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Reading is a transformative, dignity-affirming act that reveals who we are to ourselves and strengthens our shared humanity.
