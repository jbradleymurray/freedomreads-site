Introduction: A library transforms space into possibility.

Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Prisons are brutal places, both because of the violence that those incarcerated sometimes visit upon each other and because of the austere environments. Prisons are concrete and straight lines and right angles. Natural light is scarce; air is often stagnant. Men and women have spent decades without touching or seeing a tree. Freedom Reads understands that a library transforms space into possibility.</p><p>Every element of the Freedom Library’s design serves as a physical intervention into the chaos of prison, adding a beautiful and regenerative addition to the built environment. To bring nature Inside, the bookcases are carved out of solid wood: maple, cherry, oak, or walnut. Instead of bookcases that lean against a wall, the Freedom Library curves and is positioned in the middle of an open space because, as Alberto Manguel argues in <em>The Library at Night</em>, “a circular library more generously allows the reader to imagine that every last page is also the first.”</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"14ae758c-a5b8-4fe5-acd5-9554f3aed0e7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://iRvwH3W2W6XkcUHB"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"true","pagefeature":"false","sbheading":"The Curve","sbdescription":"Instead of generic bookcases that lean against a wall, Freedom Reads transforms the space around its bookcases by intentionally designing them to be objects that welcome and invite conversation. To do this, Freedom Reads made two decisions: the bookcases would be only 44 inches high and they would allow access from each side. The result is that people browsing the collection can walk around the shelves or lean over them to talk to the people on the other side.","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"416a571e-dec0-41b7-8013-a186004de0c4","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The first Freedom Library was made of reclaimed wood. Reclaimed wood comes from trees that have fallen on homes, toppled telephone cords, or been destroyed by lightning. Pieces of maple or oak or cherry that seemed worthy only of the trash heap, we transformed into the beauty of our first Freedom Library.</p><p>A Freedom Library consists of three 100-pound, handcrafted wooden bookcases and a 35-pound bench. Each library contains a carefully curated selection of 500 books.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"9d6b116c-a1dc-4ece-b631-45b7ff07db64","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://bxXcnZaD8oStDc5X"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"true","pagefeature":"false","sbheading":"The Wood","sbdescription":"The bookcases are carved out of solid wood: maple, cherry, oak, or walnut. Through their weight, their shades and colors, and their woodsy scent, the bookcases by their physical presence and composition conjure ideas of beauty, nature, and also redemption. It is Freedom Reads’ policy not to reject wood. The raw materials are carefully selected to ensure that our production processes are sustainable.","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"ff2d3a93-dc69-4a72-b1a0-d2dfa1d4a967","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The role of architecture in the hardships imposed by prison cannot be downplayed. From the foreboding physical structures to the limited access to natural light and nature, to the sensory deprivation, the architecture of prisons is a catalyst for much of the harm suffered there.</p><p>Through a collaboration with MASS Design, Freedom Reads designed, developed, and began manufacturing curving bookcases that call to mind Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famed quote, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” The Freedom Library's beautiful curving shelves can serve to counterbalance stress, anxiety, and uncertainty.</p><p>A beautiful design alone does not create a pathway to build the 20,000 Freedom Libraries necessary to make this dream a reality for everyone incarcerated. To move from the 120 hours it took to hand cut, assemble, and polish every piece of the Freedom Library, we partnered with J. Joiners, a local New Haven architectural, millwork, and machining firm that has transformed beautifully designed architectural sketches into a product that is efficiently cut and ingeniously assembled without the use of metal fasteners like nails and screws.</p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":null,"link":""},"id":"1f361857-01af-489c-83a2-80c8c1308375","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://JF7KHDTeL6rdx6jH"],"layout":"contentwidth","sidebar":"true","pagefeature":"false","sbheading":"The Joints","sbdescription":"The bookcases are assembled by fitting together carefully crafted finger joints and joining the pieces with glue. The warmth of the wood is unblemished by any visible metal or clamps. These joints symbolize the marriage of beauty and intent. Freedom Reads intentionally chose to use finger joints. They are not only beautiful, but functionally create countervailing pressures against each piece of wood, keeping them held more tightly together.","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"821dcf9d-930f-4c73-a354-35625d5d983f","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Freedom Reads' design decisions and commitments to beauty, dignity, and community guide the fabrication of every Freedom Library.</p><p>Freedom Reads designed the Freedom Library to be a thing of beauty.
