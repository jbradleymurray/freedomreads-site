Blocks: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Kites are written notes passed around in prison or sent to people on the outside. There are debates about why these letters are called “kites” – some think it is because they were originally written on Kite cigarette rolling papers, others think it is because when exchanging notes between cells, people attach string to them, to pull them back if they don't reach their destination.  Whatever the origin, letters were, for a long time, the way that people in prison connected with friends and family.  Today, to save money on phone calls or tablet texts, many people prefer the convenience and intimacy of written letters.</p><p>Freedom Reads encourages people Inside to send us kites, we always respond. </p>","sidebar":"false","pagefeature":"true","sbheading":"","sbdescription":"","buttontext":"","external":false,"link":""},"id":"c7450b6e-c974-4d2e-9991-b6910dafc216","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"On behalf of so many of us incarcerated here at St. Brides Correctional Center in Chesapeake, VA–Thank You!!! Your generous–and well-received–gifts of individual pod libraries–handsome and amazingly stocked–are wonderful, to say the least. I personally could not believe that–all of a sudden–after tackling the incredible talent of the Harlem Renaissance through scattered books–here was a brimming stock of the group’s most beloved. And, some of the best books, including these, ever written.","citation":"<strong>Erik</strong>, Freedom Library Patron at St. Brides Correctional Center in Virginia","scan":["file://ahzjj9mE480iWmyd"]},"id":"17f62a94-8508-4c44-a163-c746ca61e7cb","isHidden":false,"type":"letter"},{"content":{"text":"I remember the first day I picked up a book back in high school I viewed it as a chore and didn’t enjoy it one bit, until I was arrested many years later. While in county jail I picked up a book by J.D. Robb out of sheer boredom. I was amazed on how my bleak 8x10 concrete cell that reeked of urine and fear was turned into a magical world of flying cars, interplanetary travel and suspense. With the help of books the past 17 plus years in which I've been incarcerated were not 17 years of cesspool like living both mentally and physically. They were whatever adventure between the covers of my next book choice were. Just as now thanks to Freedom Reads donation of \"Swan Song\" by Robert McCammon, I’m in a post nuclear apocalyptic world where despite the carnage and destruction, I'm shown that the world is what you make it. That even at the worst of times there is always hope and a light at the end of the tunnel, all I have to do is choose to walk and act in such manner.","citation":"<strong>Christopher</strong>, Freedom Library Patron at Valley State Prison in California","scan":["file://fJsBscQnOQfxsBl7"]},"id":"3ad7dfdf-6c15-4c68-b9f0-829d921e87bf","isHidden":false,"type":"letter"},{"content":{"text":"The smell of wood and the smell of a new book takes me right out of this place! I have been incarcerated 20 yrs. and am doing life. … I love books and am an avid reader! I have been since I was a little girl. … Our bookshelf is in the dayroom. I couldn't check it out for the first few days and when I could, I was so happy and joyful. It made me feel free...Thank you again.","citation":"<strong>Hillary</strong>, Freedom Library Patron at Central California Women’s Facility","scan":["file://pZShXIJD4ZopOQ1E"]},"id":"256b1f48-f18a-4136-97e7-f22f7a0db1fb","isHidden":false,"type":"letter"},{"content":{"text":"I myself have been incarcerated for over 23 years since I was 20 years old. When I ended up in prison I could not speak English since I’m originally from Moscow, Russia. What changed my life was reading books. ... Nowadays, besides being an author, a poet, I have also become an activist, and an educator. My goal is to bring awareness to the public that there are prisoners who have changed their lives because of education. … I like to share my story with everyone whether that person is a politician, correctional officer, a prisoner, religious or atheist. Since at the end of the day we are all human beings who try to evolve and become better.","citation":"<strong>Artem</strong>, Freedom Library Patron at MCI-Norfolk in Massachusetts","scan":["file://u5XckWtSb6phds1o"]},"id":"46f0d1da-3e8e-437c-9cf4-63e83c3ddf6f","isHidden":false,"type":"letter"},{"content":{"text":"I live in the assisted living area and can barely see or stand sometimes.

I spent minutes watching them, since this was so unusual in the sameness of prison life, and I had no idea what was going on. Then they brought out a bunch of boxes and filled those odd, curvy shelves with brand new, bright, colorful books. ... I have been in prison...most of my adult life. In that time, everything has been very bleak, prisons are all old, crumbling, dirty, worn out - so to see something fresh and new was really cool. And the shelves are literally five feet from my door, so I see them every time I look out. I love books. I always have. A lot of the experiences in my life have not been positive, but books have ever been my constant companion. Thank you for the books.","citation":"<strong>Cameron</strong>, Freedom Library Patron at Correctional Training Facility in California","scan":["file://UqgwL2GhYosd0Irx"]},"id":"7952b64b-a22e-4e80-ada5-fede397d95b0","isHidden":false,"type":"letter"}]
